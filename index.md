## What makes a wrong proof profound?

A proof that fails due to an algebraic- or arithmetic-error only reduces the search space by one.  A proof that fails due to a fundamental obstacle can shed light on an entire class of approaches, and prune down the search tree.  Occasionally a proof can fail so profoundly that it results in a [new field of mathematics](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~jrabinoff6/mathcamp/lectures.pdf).  Organizing and publishing these can help us move closer to a solution.

## What is this page?

This is not meant for sharing new work, getting feedback on attempted solutions, or attempting to prove the Riemann Hypothesis.

This is community-driven and you can [edit it on Github](http://github.com/rfurman/pnphard/) or [chat and discuss on Discord](https://discord.gg/5aZ3VAB).

## Which hard problems do we cover?

So far, the [Riemann Hypothesis](/blems/riemann/).

There are many other problems to discuss and we are [seeking volunteer editors](mailto:rcf@acm.org) to own these.
